# Predicting Disease Incidence Based on Demographic and Lifestyle Factors
Sienna, Sachin, and Bianca's DSCI 303 project

## .csv files
The 9 csv files split the BRFSS available here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system?select=2015.csv into 9 parts so it could be loaded easily into the notebook. 

## Notebook
Much of the modeling in the notebook is commented out, but the results are either included in the paper or commented out in the code. 

## Report Abstract
Health outcomes are influenced by multiple lifestyle and demographic factors. However, some factors are more important than others in predicting various types of diseases. Logistic regression models were created to analyze the importance of these features based on the 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) Survey for four diseases: heart disease, asthma, cancer, and diabetes. The results indicated that the logistic regression models to predict heart disease and diabetes performed more accurately than the machines for asthma and cancer. This study also showed that only some of the previously identified risk factors are heavily correlated with predicting the disease a person has, while other features were unexpectedly less correlated. However, difficulties predicting the incidence of disease suggest that there are factors not in the data analyzed in this study, also impacting whether someone develops one of these four diseases.
