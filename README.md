# SSB_DSCI303
Sienna, Sachin, and Bianca's DSCI 303 project

The 9 csv files split the BRFSS available here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cdc/behavioral-risk-factor-surveillance-system?select=2015.csv into 9 parts so it could be loaded easily into the notebook. 

Much of the modeling in the notebook is commented out, but the results are either included in the paper or commented out in the code.
